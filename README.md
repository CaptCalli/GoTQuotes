# GoTQuotes

GoTQuotes stands for Game of Thrones Quotes. 

# Description

Game of Thrones Quotes is a simple webpage displaying various Game of Thrones quotes by specific characters. 
[GoTQuotes Website](https://kittykerns.github.io/GoTQuotes/)

# Usage

Open the webpage, and click on any character to receive a new random quote from that specific character.

On a new load/reload the quote will default to "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground."

If the quote does not seem to change, this simply means that the same quote was randomly selected again. I have not yet built in a function to avoid duplicates back-to-back.

I am aware that the code can be condensed. It will be tabled for now, and likely reworked in the future.
